Welcome to **TerraVerse 3D**, our final year project that brings videos to life as interactive 3D models!

## What is TerraVerse 3D?

TerraVerse 3D is a web-based tool that lets users upload a simple videoâ€”captured by drone or phoneâ€”and transforms it into a full 3D model. Itâ€™s built to modernize real estate and beyond by making 3D visualization fast, easy, and accessible.

## Key Features

- **Video to 3D Conversion**: Just upload a video, and TerraVerse 3D creates a 3D model.
- **Smooth Point Clouds**: We use advanced techniques like Gaussian Splatting to make point clouds clean and realistic.
- **Mesh Generation**: The raw point cloud is converted into a 3D mesh using Sugar for a more complete model.

## A Dash of Tech

- Behind the scenes, we mix cutting-edge algorithms and AI to create crisp point clouds and meshes.  
- You can create mesh alongside, to edit your model on unity or other game engins.


## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. You upload a video.
2. We extract information from the video using computer vision.
3. A 3D point cloud is created and improved with Gaussian Splatting.

## Why We Built This

Real estate is one of the worldâ€™s biggest industries, yet it still relies heavily on 2D images and in-person tours. TerraVerse 3D fills this gap by offering an engaging and modern way to explore properties in 3Dâ€”directly from a simple video.

## Built With

- **COLMAP** â€“ For camera pose and depth extraction.
- **Gaussian Splatting** â€“ For generating high-quality point clouds.
- **Sugar** â€“ For mesh generation.

## Try It Yourself

1. Launch the app.
2. Upload your video.
3. View your 3D model and interact using the chatbot.
